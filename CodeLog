Importing Bruce Porter's AM version in prolog. Doesn't run in gprolog -
perhaps we need to mess with modules.

Now am.pl compiles. But what does abolish do?
=-=2 - Sat Nov 29 10:40:30 PST 2008

Getting the rest of the files to compile. One error remaining:
  h92.pl:166:58: syntax error: current or previous operator needs brackets
IMPORTANT: replaced commas with periods to respect indentation in 2 heuristics.

Minor fixes:
  disable definition: ucall/1.
  disable duplicate definitions: collectclauses/3 in common and utilities, print_put_trace in common and am.
  disable primitives: reverse, nth, list, append, member, delete, makelist.
  rename duplicate private definition: loop_composit/8 in h407 -> loop_composit2.

  update syntax for directives: abolish, public, dynamic.
  amutilities -> multiple files.
  explicitly consult files in am_init.
  assert -> assertz.
  remove no_style_check directives.
  multiline -> single-line strings.

Ok, it compiles now, though I need to call load_am_files separately before am.
am dies within various abolish calls that I can comment out to get it to run.
Don't want to save those until I figure out what I'm doing.

make those procedures dynamic right at the start. Now is it hung or just
processing for a long time?
=-=7 - Thu Dec 11 12:23:44 PST 2008
No, I need to call:
  [am].
  load_am_files.
  [am].
  am.
for it to work/hang.
=-=8 - Thu Dec 11 12:28:39 PST 2008
Ok, now I can start it up with just:
  [am].
  am.
=-=9 - Thu Dec 11 12:30:41 PST 2008
assert->assertz in heuristics.
